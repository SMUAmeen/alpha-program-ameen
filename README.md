## Step 7: Transfer Your Repository to Traders@SMU Organization

There are three methods to transfer your repository to the Traders@SMU organization. Choose the method that best suits your comfort level with Git and GitHub.

### Method 1: GitHub Web Interface Transfer (Recommended for Beginners)

1. Go to your repository's settings on GitHub:
   - Navigate to your repository page
   - Click on "Settings" in the top menu bar
   - Scroll down to the "Danger Zone" section
   - Click "Transfer" under "Transfer ownership"

2. In the transfer dialog:
   - Type your repository name to confirm
   - Enter "Traders-SMU" as the new owner
   - Click "I understand, transfer this repository"

3. After the transfer:
   - Update your local repository's remote URL:
     ```bash
     git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Traders-SMU/your-repository-name.git
     ```
   - Verify the new remote URL:
     ```bash
     git remote -v
     ```

### Method 2: Organization Invitation (Recommended for Team Collaboration)

1. Request an invitation to the Traders@SMU organization:
   - Contact your program administrator
   - Provide your GitHub username
   - Wait for the invitation email from GitHub

2. Accept the organization invitation:
   - Click the invitation link in your email
   - Or go to https://github.com/Traders-SMU
   - Click "View Invitation" and accept it

3. Transfer your repository:
   - Follow the same steps as Method 1
   - You'll now have direct access to the organization

4. Set up branch protection (Optional):
   - Go to repository settings
   - Click "Branches" in the left sidebar
   - Add branch protection rules as specified by your administrator

### Method 3: Command Line Transfer (Advanced Users)

1. Create a new repository in the Traders@SMU organization:
   - Get organization admin access (contact your program administrator)
   - Use the GitHub API to create a new repository:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" \
     https://api.github.com/orgs/Traders-SMU/repos \
     -d '{"name":"your-repository-name","private":true}'
     ```

2. Push your existing repository:
   ```bash
   # Add the new remote
   git remote add organization https://github.com/Traders-SMU/your-repository-name.git
   
   # Push all branches and tags
   git push organization --all
   git push organization --tags
   
   # Set the organization remote as your new origin
   git remote remove origin
   git remote rename organization origin
   ```

3. Verify the transfer:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   git fetch origin
   git status
   ```

### Important Notes

1. **Before transferring:**
   - Make sure you have a backup of your repository
   - Complete any pending commits and pushes
   - Document any open issues or pull requests

2. **After transferring:**
   - Update any local repository references
   - Notify collaborators of the new repository location
   - Update any continuous integration or deployment settings

## Receiving Updates Throughout the Course

As the course progresses, we'll add new materials for upcoming weeks (Week 2, Week 3, etc.). You'll need to update your repository to get these new materials. Here's how:

### Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface (Easiest Method)

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub
2. Look for the message that says "This branch is X commits behind Traders-SMU:main"
3. Click on "Sync fork" near the top of the page
4. Click "Update branch" to get the latest changes
5. Once updated online, pull the changes to your local repository:
   - In GitHub Desktop: Click "Fetch origin" then "Pull origin"
   - In Git command line: Run `git pull origin main`

### Option 2: Using Git Command Line (More Control)

First time setup (only do this once):
```bash
# Add the original repository as an "upstream" remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Traders-SMU/student-template.git
```

Whenever you need to get updates:
```bash
# Make sure you're on your main branch
git checkout main

# Get the latest changes from the original repository
git fetch upstream

# Merge those changes into your local repository
git merge upstream/main

# Push the updated content to your GitHub repository
git push origin main
```

### Handling Merge Conflicts

If you've modified files that were also updated in the original repository, you might see a "merge conflict." This happens when Git can't automatically determine which changes to keep.

If you encounter merge conflicts:

1. Look for files marked as conflicted in GitHub Desktop or listed in the command line output
2. Open these files in a text editor - you'll see sections marked with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`
3. Edit the file to keep the changes you want (remove the marker lines and unwanted content)
4. Save the file
5. Mark the conflict as resolved:
   - In GitHub Desktop: Right-click the file and select "Mark as resolved"
   - In Git command line: Run `git add <filename>` for each resolved file
6. Complete the merge:
   - In GitHub Desktop: Click "Commit merge"
   - In Git command line: Run `git commit`

If you're unsure how to resolve conflicts, reach out to your instructor for assistance.

### When to Update Your Repository

We recommend checking for updates:
- At the beginning of each week
- Whenever an announcement is made about new materials
- If you encounter references to files that don't exist in your repository

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Fatal: Repository not found" Error

This usually means the repository URL is incorrect or you don't have access.
- Check that you're using the correct URL
- Make sure you've created your own copy of the template repository

### "Permission denied" Error

This typically means you don't have write access to the repository.
- Make sure you're pushing to your own repository, not the original template
- Check that you've set up your GitHub authentication correctly

### Changes Not Showing Up

If your changes aren't appearing on GitHub:
- Make sure you've committed your changes (`git commit`)
- Make sure you've pushed your changes (`git push`)
- Check that you're on the correct branch

### "Updates were rejected" Error

This usually means there are changes on GitHub that you don't have locally.
- Pull the latest changes first: `git pull origin main`
- Then try pushing again

## Getting Help

If you encounter any issues:
- Ask a classmate who might be familiar with Git
- Contact your program instructor
- Search for your error message on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- Refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en)

## Git/GitHub Terminology

- **Repository (Repo)**: A storage location for your project
- **Clone**: Creating a local copy of a repository on your computer

- **Fork**: A copy of a repository that you manage
- **Upstream**: The original repository that you created your copy from

Remember, everyone starts somewhere with Git! Don't be afraid to ask questions if you get stuck.
