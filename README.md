## Getting Started (Easy Setup Guide)

### Step 1: One-Time Setup (Do this first!)

1. **Install GitHub Desktop**
   - Go to [GitHub Desktop Download Page](https://desktop.github.com/)
   - Download and install GitHub Desktop for your computer
   - If you don't have a GitHub account, create one at [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
   - Open GitHub Desktop and sign in with your GitHub account

2. **Get Access to Traders@SMU**
   - Email your instructor with:
     - Your full name
     - Your GitHub username
     - Your program level (L1 or L2)
   - Wait for confirmation email that you've been added to the organization

### Step 2: Create Your Repository

1. **Create from Template**
   - Go to the [Traders@SMU student-template](https://github.com/Traders-SMU/student-template)
   - Click the green "Use this template" button
   - Select "Create a new repository"
   - For repository name, use this format exactly: `traders-smu-LEVEL-FULLNAME`
     - Example: If you're John Smith in L1: `traders-smu-L1-john-smith`
     - Example: If you're Jane Doe in L2: `traders-smu-L2-jane-doe`
   - Choose "Private" for repository visibility
   - Click "Create repository from template"

### Step 3: Set Up Local Copy

1. **Clone with GitHub Desktop**
   - Open GitHub Desktop
   - Click "File" ‚Üí "Clone repository"
   - Find your new repository in the list
   - Choose where to save it on your computer
     - Remember this location! You'll need it later
   - Click "Clone"

### Step 4: Set Up Automatic Sync (One-Time Setup)

1. **Get Your Access Tokens** (Important!)
   
   You'll need two special passwords (tokens) to set up syncing:

   a) **GitHub Personal Access Token**:
   - Go to [GitHub Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - For "Note" write: "Course Access Token"
   - Set expiration to "No expiration"
   - Check these boxes:
     - [x] repo (all)
     - [x] workflow
     - [x] admin:org
   - Click "Generate token" at the bottom
   - üìù COPY THE TOKEN AND SAVE IT! You won't see it again

   b) **Organization Sync Token**:
   - Ask your instructor for this token in class
   - They will give you a code that starts with `ghp_` or `github_pat_`
   - Save it somewhere safe!

2. **Add Your Tokens to GitHub**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub.com
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Click "Secrets and variables" ‚Üí "Actions"
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Add your first token:
     - Name: `GITHUB_TOKEN`
     - Value: Paste your GitHub Personal Access Token
     - Click "Add secret"
   - Click "New repository secret" again
   - Add your second token:
     - Name: `ORG_SYNC_TOKEN`
     - Value: Paste the token from your instructor
     - Click "Add secret"

3. **Create the Sync File**
   - In GitHub Desktop, click "Repository" ‚Üí "Open in Finder/Explorer"
   - Create these folders inside your repository: `.github/workflows`
   - Inside the `workflows` folder, create a new file named `sync-to-org.yml`
   - Open this file in any text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, etc.)
   - Copy and paste this exact text:

```yaml
name: Sync to Traders@SMU

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'

jobs:
  sync-to-org:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          
      - name: Push to Traders@SMU
        run: |
          git remote add traders-smu https://${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}@github.com/Traders-SMU/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY#*/}.git
          git push traders-smu --all --force
          git push traders-smu --tags --force
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ORG_SYNC_TOKEN }}
```

4. **Test Your Setup**
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
   - You should see "Sync to Traders@SMU" workflow
   - Make a small test change (like add a space to README.md)
   - Commit and push the change
   - Check if the sync works (green checkmark)

‚ùó **Important Token Safety**:
- Never share your tokens with anyone (except your instructor)
- Don't put tokens in your files
- If you accidentally expose a token, tell your instructor immediately
- Keep your tokens somewhere safe - they're like passwords!

üÜò **Token Problems?**
1. Check the token names are exactly `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `ORG_SYNC_TOKEN`
2. Make sure you copied the entire token (they're long!)
3. Ask your instructor for help if needed

### Step 5: Daily Usage

1. **View or Edit Files**
   - Open GitHub Desktop
   - Click on your repository
   - Click "Open in Finder/Explorer" to view files
   - Make changes to files as needed for assignments

2. **Save Your Changes (Super Easy Method)**
   - In GitHub Desktop:
     - Click the "Fetch origin" button (‚Üì) at the top
     - Click "Pull origin" if it appears
     - Type a short note about what you changed
     - Click "Commit to main"
     - Click "Push origin" (‚Üë)

That's it! Your work will automatically sync to the Traders@SMU organization.

### Need Help?

If you get stuck:
1. Ask your instructor for help
2. Send screenshots of any error messages
3. Share your repository name and GitHub username

### Alternative Setup Methods

If you're comfortable with Git and GitHub, you can also:
1. Use the GitHub web interface directly
2. Use Visual Studio Code's Git features
3. Use other Git GUI clients

For advanced setup instructions, scroll down to the "Advanced Setup Options" section below.

## Receiving Updates Throughout the Course

As the course progresses, we'll add new materials for upcoming weeks (Week 2, Week 3, etc.). You'll need to update your repository to get these new materials. Here's how:

### Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface (Easiest Method)

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub
2. Look for the message that says "This branch is X commits behind Traders-SMU:main"
3. Click on "Sync fork" near the top of the page
4. Click "Update branch" to get the latest changes
5. Once updated online, pull the changes to your local repository:
   - In GitHub Desktop: Click "Fetch origin" then "Pull origin"
   - In Git command line: Run `git pull origin main`

### Option 2: Using Git Command Line (More Control)

First time setup (only do this once):
```bash
# Add the original repository as an "upstream" remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Traders-SMU/student-template.git
```

Whenever you need to get updates:
```bash
# Make sure you're on your main branch
git checkout main

# Get the latest changes from the original repository
git fetch upstream

# Merge those changes into your local repository
git merge upstream/main

# Push the updated content to your GitHub repository
git push origin main
```

### Handling Merge Conflicts

If you've modified files that were also updated in the original repository, you might see a "merge conflict." This happens when Git can't automatically determine which changes to keep.

If you encounter merge conflicts:

1. Look for files marked as conflicted in GitHub Desktop or listed in the command line output
2. Open these files in a text editor - you'll see sections marked with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`
3. Edit the file to keep the changes you want (remove the marker lines and unwanted content)
4. Save the file
5. Mark the conflict as resolved:
   - In GitHub Desktop: Right-click the file and select "Mark as resolved"
   - In Git command line: Run `git add <filename>` for each resolved file
6. Complete the merge:
   - In GitHub Desktop: Click "Commit merge"
   - In Git command line: Run `git commit`

If you're unsure how to resolve conflicts, reach out to your instructor for assistance.

### When to Update Your Repository

We recommend checking for updates:
- At the beginning of each week
- Whenever an announcement is made about new materials
- If you encounter references to files that don't exist in your repository

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Fatal: Repository not found" Error

This usually means the repository URL is incorrect or you don't have access.
- Check that you're using the correct URL
- Make sure you've created your own copy of the template repository

### "Permission denied" Error

This typically means you don't have write access to the repository.
- Make sure you're pushing to your own repository, not the original template
- Check that you've set up your GitHub authentication correctly

### Changes Not Showing Up

If your changes aren't appearing on GitHub:
- Make sure you've committed your changes (`git commit`)
- Make sure you've pushed your changes (`git push`)
- Check that you're on the correct branch

### "Updates were rejected" Error

This usually means there are changes on GitHub that you don't have locally.
- Pull the latest changes first: `git pull origin main`
- Then try pushing again

## Getting Help

If you encounter any issues:
- Ask a classmate who might be familiar with Git
- Contact your program instructor
- Search for your error message on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- Refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en)
